# House-Price-Prediction-Project-
The House Price Prediction project focuses on building a regression model to predict
house prices based on key features such as the number of rooms, square footage, and
neighborhood characteristics. This project uses the Boston Housing Dataset, which
contains various housing-related attributes. The project involves exploratory data analysis
EDA) to understand data patterns, training a linear regression model for prediction, ang
visualizing the relationship between actual and predicted prices. Python libraries such as
pandas and seaborn are used for data analysis and visualization, while scikit-learn is
used to implement the regression model. The goalis to build an interpretable and efficient
model that can accurately estimate house prices.
